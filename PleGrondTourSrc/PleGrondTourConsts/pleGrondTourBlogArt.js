    preview: 'When I first walked along the Atlantic shore in Nova...',
    full: 'When I first walked along the Atlantic shore in Nova Scotia, I realized something remarkable: this was only a tiny fraction of Canada’s immense coastline. Canada has the longest coastline in the world, stretching across oceans, islands, fjords, and Arctic inlets. Every bend reveals something different—fishing villages, dramatic cliffs, peaceful bays. The coast feels endless, and in many ways, it truly is.',

    full: 'At dawn in the Rockies, the peaks seemed to glow with their own light, as if waking before the rest of the world. The cool morning air carried the scent of pine and distant ice. Standing there, I felt both small and protected, part of something ancient. The mountains do not ask for attention—they simply command it.',

    full: 'Cobblestone streets and the sound of church bells welcomed me in Old Quebec. The early sun painted the stone walls in warm gold, and the cafés were just beginning to open. Every corner felt like a story waiting to be told. It was impossible not to slow down and enjoy the quiet beauty of a city that has never lost its charm.',

    full: 'Some lakes in Canada are so clear they seem to mirror the entire sky. When I first stepped onto the shores of Moraine Lake, the water looked unreal—bright turquoise framed by towering peaks. It felt like the kind of place that resets your thoughts. Nature can be calm or powerful, but here, it was simply perfect.',

    full: 'Deep in Stanley Park, the air becomes thicker and greener. Every step leads deeper into quiet forest, where the sound of the city fades into the background. Tall cedars rise like living pillars, and sunlight breaks through in soft patterns. Walking here feels like discovering a different world hidden inside the urban one.',

    full: 'The first time I saw the Aurora in Yukon, it moved faster than I expected—dancing across the sky in waves of green and violet. The world around me was silent, covered in snow that reflected the light like a mirror. Time felt suspended. In that moment, I understood why people travel so far to witness something so delicate and powerful.',

    full: 'Along the Fundy coast, every rock formation has a story to tell. The world’s highest tides carve the shoreline day after day, creating shapes that look almost otherworldly. When I walked there at low tide, I felt like I was exploring a landscape painted by water itself. The ocean never repeats the same design twice.',

    full: 'Toronto’s skyline looks different when you see it from the lake. The buildings seem taller, sharper, and somehow calmer. As the boat moved across the water, the city felt both massive and peaceful. Sometimes the best way to understand a place is to step back and see how it fits into the horizon.',

    full: 'On the shores of Newfoundland, small fishing villages appear like colorful dots against the rugged coast. Life moves slowly there, measured not by hours but by tides and weather. People greet you like an old friend, even if they’ve never seen you before. It’s a reminder that simplicity can feel richer than any luxury.',

    full: 'The first time I faced an old-growth cedar in British Columbia, I felt dwarfed by its size and silence. These trees have lived through centuries, storms, and generations of people. Standing beneath them is like stepping into a cathedral made of wood and wind. It’s impossible not to breathe deeper there.',

    full: 'There’s something comforting about the Pacific Ocean—its rhythm feels ancient and familiar. On Tofino’s beaches, the sound of waves blends with wind and distant seabirds. People walk slowly there, lost in their thoughts. Every wave brings a feeling of calm, like the ocean is reminding you to breathe.',

    full: 'Driving into northern Canada feels like following a road into silence. Forests stretch endlessly on both sides, broken only by rivers and wandering wildlife. The farther you go, the more the world seems untouched. It’s a journey that teaches you how wide the country truly is—and how much beauty hides in places few people visit.',
